# Portfolio Images

Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working at [CRSP Center for Research in Security Prices](https://crsp.org). I'm a member of the Market Indexes Software Development team responsible for the systems that produce the data that backs legendary securities like [MGC](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/mgc) and [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti#overview). I just completed my first year at CRSP and have been shifting gears toward everything data and finance data. Previous to CRSP I worked at [DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/iot-lab/) Data Science Institute allocated to the Internet Equity Initiative ([IEI](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/)) as a Backend/Data Engineer. I'm fascinated by the decision-making processes and data-driven visualizations, finance, and product design. I'm known for my previous experience with computer networks leading the full-stack work of [https://beadchallenge.org](https://beadchallenge.org) and [Netrics](http://tigerteam.cs.uchicago.edu).

Instead of a wordy cv/resume, here's a more relaxed collage of images with important documentation of my work as most of it is open source. Disclaimer: some conclusions here are my own.

  Figure 1. This is the Netrics backend stack I was responsible for on the left. In prod for 3 years and crossed the 1 billion data-point mark of encrypted data. The stack includes small Golang data collection applications, python and terraform IaC, SQL database, parallel Python data ingestion, Kafka producer/consumers. On the right, is the System Design for https://beadchallenge.org.

  Figure 2. Aggregated average latency (active unloaded ICMP) for all Netrics deployed devices in Chicago city. As expected: fiber tech has lower latency compared to the other technologies. Data warehoused on TimescaleDB, image extracted from Superset BI tool. Estimated devices deployed: 120 in Chicago area. We benchmark the internet for ISPs to ensure internet consumers are getting a fair performance from their contracted services and understand any significant differences between regions that are considered to be antagonistic from their socio-economic characteristics.

  Figure 3. A Netrics Grafana dashboard with fluctuation on both latency and speed test. Hypothesis to be investigated: fluctuations like this are unperceived by internet users, but they might impact high-performance game players.

  Figure 6. Data analysis work for the Internet Equity Initiative group. Does the low-income population have worse internet performance than the high-income? What does it mean to be an underserved or unserved area regarding broadband infrastructure? Is the broadband evolving in the US (2019 - 2021 comparison)?

      Figure 8. My earlier work (circa 2009-2011) on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for Alcatel-Lucent, programming CloudShield/IBM equipment (PacketC / C ). I was the principal engineer for the protocol/app service detection intelligence of the network traffic control engine called Agya. The solution was deployed in the Latin America region, mainly in Brazil.
